# One Piece maze
## Description
This is a One Piece themed, self-solvable maze. I made it for a school project, which was graded.
## Functionalities
The maze is a SVG image made on canvas. There are 2 buttons:
  - Start button (starts drawing a line from start to finnish of the maze. When the line reaches the finnish end of the maze, drawing stops)
  - Clear Line button (clears the previously drawn line. The button doesn't automatically start drawing a new line)
